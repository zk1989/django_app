Breakfastory is a repository of ideas for meals. Ideas - not recipes.

Everyday life is so full of decision-making. After a day's work, sometimes it's hard to even think of WHAT to eat, let alone how to prepare it. Here, we're solving the former problem for you. Breakfastory ideas are short, the ingredients easily available in the well-known shops, which are usually opened all day long. Grab your phone and find the shopping list you've been looking for!

Breakfastory was created as an exercise while going through Python Crash Course 3rd Edition (2023). The code is strictly based on Chapters 18, 19 and 20.
