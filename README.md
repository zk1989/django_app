Breakfastory is your repository of ideas for meals. Ideas - not recipes.

Everyday life is full of decision-making. After a day's work, sometimes it's hard to even think of WHAT to eat, let alone how to prepare it. This is why breakfastory ideas are meant to be short, and the ingredients easily available in the well-known shops. Grab your phone on the weekend and create your basic shopping lists. They'll come handy on a weekday, once you're in a shop, tired and confused.

Breakfastory was created as an exercise while going through Python Crash Course 3rd Edition (2023). The code is strictly based on Chapters 18, 19 and 20. The sheer idea of a breakfastory is proprietary.
